   * Add functionality to this component. The button should attempt to log you in or sign out
   * if logged in. You should also display a little welcome message next to the button 
   * if the user is signed in, such as "Hello, Jane Doe!".
   * 
   * Tips:
   * 1. The imports above are all that you need.
   * 2. You want to manage when a user is logged in...maybe a state?
   * 3. The `useAuth` hook will give you back a user, which has a displayName property.
